    activityDescription: We don't sell anything here. We get our spices from Writa,
      our salt from New Tarbury, and our art from Ardas.  Writa only sells in bulk
      but I think Prifield has spices too if you can't afford a bigger order.
    activityResult: Like I said, we don't sell anything here.
